## API & Documentation

### DSTouch 

The `DSTouch` class constructs objects that represent a single Nintendo DS Touch screen component.

```js
var touch = new DSTouch();

touch.on("change", function() {
  console.log(this.x, this.y);
});
```

#### Parameters

| Property   | Type      | Value(s)/Description      | Default | Required |
|------------|-----------|---------------------------|---------|----------|
| address    | number    | Address for I2C device \* | `0x04`  | no       |


```js
// Example of explicitly specified address
var touch = new DSTouch({
  address: 0x04
});
```

\* The address used by this "backpack" component is `0x04`. This can be changed by [modifying the value in the firmware](https://github.com/rwaldron/j5-ds-touch/blob/master/firmware/ds_touch_slave.ino#L3). 

#### Properties

| Property   | Type      | Value(s)/Description      |
|------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| x    | number    | The `x` coordinate of the present touch point. Will read `1023` if there is no touch point.  |
| y    | number    | The `y` coordinate of the present touch point. Will read `1023` if there is no touch point.  |


#### Events

- **change** Fired whenever the `[x, y]` coordinates of the pointer has changed.

- **data** Fired as frequently as the hardware can be read.

- **down / pointerdown** The pointer makes physical contact with the surface, but was previously not touching the surface (similar to the browser **mousedown** or **pointerdown** event).

- **move / pointermove** The pointer is touching the surface and has changed coordinates since the last position was read (similar to the browser **mousemove** or **pointermove** event).

- **up / pointerup** The pointer no longer has physical contact with surface, but was previously touching the surface (similar to the browser **mouseup** or **pointerup** event).


NOTE: The word _pointer_ means either capacitive or resistive stylus, or finger.



## Backpack Controller

### Install Firmware

Using the Arduino IDE, install the [firmware](https://github.com/rwaldron/j5-ds-touch/blob/master/firmware/ds_touch_slave.ino) to your AVR based microcontroller of choice.

## Ploma App

This repo comes with a version of @evhan55's example [Ploma](https://github.com/evhan55/ploma) app that has been modified to accept input from a socket instead of a Wacom tablet. 

![Hello Ploma](https://github.com/rwaldron/j5-ds-touch/blob/master/assets/hello-ploma.png)


To Run: 


```sh
node eg/server.js
```



## NOTE

The examples shown here are provided for illustration and do no specifically indicate platform support. This component class is expected to work with any platform that has I2C support.
